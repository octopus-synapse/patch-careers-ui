/**
 * Editorial palette — the "Editorial Calm" auth/onboarding aesthetic.
 *
 * Warm paper background, deep-ink CTA, hairline rules, blue used sparingly
 * (focus rings + links + accent dot only). These were previously local to
 * `apps/client/src/components/auth/auth-shared.tsx` (`authTokens`); they now
 * live here so the Tamagui wrapper can register an `editorial` sub-theme and
 * `@patch-careers/ui/editorial` components can consume them.
 *
 * Two variants share one shape: `editorialPalette` (light, warm paper) and
 * `editorialPaletteDark` (warm dark paper — near-black with the same warm
 * cast, inverted ink, CTA flips to a light fill). Components resolve the
 * active one via `useEditorialPalette()` in `@patch-careers/ui`.
 *
 * NOTE: the serif/sans/mono font stack stays in `apps/client/tamagui.config.ts`
 * (it needs `Platform.select`, and this package is platform-agnostic). Here we
 * only own the raw hex palette.
